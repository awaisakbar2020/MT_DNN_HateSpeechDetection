6132	none	@vex0rian @Sir5000 @StormsOnSaturn yeah  i've got a cron to kick it. it must not be kicking it properly.
6133	none	but that seems gross  and not really how this tool should be used. can do better w/other things  this is more for an overview.
6134	none	@ctmf but if they do  i'm happy to turn my graphs over to twitter's abuse department. i don't think the people i'm watching would risk that.

6169	none	@cheeseplus yeah. i'm kind of feeling like for what i'm doing  wsp is ok. for doing more granular monitoring  redis would be good.

6176	none	@JimmyMcCunty @Spacekatgal oh  darn  you can't? shoot.
6177	none	In the past 12 hrs  GG hashtag saw 1018 tweets/hr (776 of which were RTs). Min: 662 (473) Max: 1519 (1233). majority of non-RT came from bot

6180	none	@cheeseplus @obfuscurity i got statsd/graphite working on freebsd once  but then i switched to connected line graphs and it crashed?!
6181	none	it would be possible with a super low retention for graphs  i guess  and *.wsp files that are deleted if they aren't updated in N minutes?
6182	none	@p8952_ @mjg59 the fact that twitter makes it easier to interact with those you're not connected to may have more to do with this.
6183	none	@cheeseplus no pretty graphs easily generated out of redis  tho. i'd have to learn R or somesuch.
6184	none	@onebrightlight i've been talking to 2 employees and i heard about a lot of the internal politics re: GG. it's enough to make me stay.

6198	none	@cheeseplus @obfuscurity i don't wanna devops this. i just want it to work so i can do other things. i need a devops.
6199	none	@ctmf they are already setting up  bots to tweet with the hashtag to inflate it. i don't really see this making much of a difference.
6200	none	@informationchef i haven't really had to go plonking around in graphite before. this stuff is practically a foreign language.
6201	none	Been doing things. Going to have some pretty automated stuff to show you all soon  but for now  some kinda neat stuff I found.

6205	none	Can I make graphite show the sum of 5m when retention is 1m? Want to see a graph with point every 5m with sum of that time period.
6206	none	@m1sp hey  do you have a good way to consume multiple json dumps into a single corpus? i've been just hacking it together.
6207	none	@GregTheTerrible you should read the developer policy irt deleted tweets. It should comfort you ;)

6211	none	go figure that silicon valley circle jerk elite don't realize that some people can't afford $10/month to not be harassed.
6212	none	take off your VC fedoras and think about what this really is. it's about the right that anyone has to not be harassed &amp; threatened.
6213	none	@GravityPike @tomdcc uhh. through what point of ingress?
6214	none	i'm still entertained that jason's idea is to either pay a fee or make your acct protected. i'd love to hear his thoughts on short skirts.
6215	none	@GemmaNoon it's what i'm *trying* to do  at least targeting specific groups/causes. it's tricky. have to look more at statistics than words.
6216	none	@eDRoaCH unaware of their issues. do they not have cell phones/access to GV?
6217	none	@Spacekatgal the client/web experience being similar are key. i don't know if twitter client has the additional controls verified accts have

6225	none	*whispers* hey guys. being free from abuse/harassment doesn't have to be monetized. it should be for everyone. i can show you the way.
6226	none	@eDRoaCH @twitter the number doesn't have to be stored to be ensured unique...
6227	none	@eDRoaCH @orvtech this isn't de-anonymizing. the phone # wouldn't necessarily be stored. no names would be required.

6230	none	pseudonyms are good. own it! anonymous is not the same thing. what jason/wadhwa are promoting would require ID/home address/PAY TO USE
6231	none	@banhammor @Spacekatgal @GlennF i think during GDC we should have a social justice league meetup at my apt kthx.
6232	none	@Transition @GlennF @Spacekatgal that's the one.
6233	none	Verified accts for all is an OK idea  but too much administrative overhead. There are better ways  which I've talked about in the past.

6235	none	@RachelLite why would it?
6236	none	@tomdcc nothing will ever be perfect  but this is a good start towards fixing a HUGE percentage of harassment.
6237	none	@Spacekatgal this is more from a consumer side  though. from a business side? one could see email SPAM as falling under that category.

6242	none	Just a reminder  this is the kind of logic &amp; reasoning that we've come to expect from GG: http://t.co/7RjxqC3ZsG
6243	none	@Spacekatgal yeahhhh. they were operating a loss until facebook bought them. fbook didn't buy them to make money off the service.
6244	none	I just saw that 3 people requested that I update my Amazon Wish-List. Hm. I usually only use it to track things I plan on buying eventually.
6245	none	Wow. I might be out of blue hair dye. But I have a tube of Pravana that is purple... // @TheQuinnspiracy
6246	none	@tomdcc not everyone can afford cell phones. GV is a good alternative. we don't want to turn twitter into a classist thing.
6247	none	@nimrod_KatDogg  i own too many apple products to say that.
6248	none	phone # idea isn't perfect (it's easy enough to grab a phone # from GV)  but it's an extra step - good deterrent for majority of abuse.
6249	none	@eDRoaCH @twitter think about how passwords work. are they stored in plaintext? can the provider easily decrypt them? nope.
6250	none	@jackyalcine it's not a battery  it's a usb hub.
6251	none	@Arlen weird. i have an address on my account. not sure if i need to add that to my wishlist or not.
6252	none	@EvvyKube no  I bathe in those.
6253	none	@tomdcc i met with them weeks ago. :P  who knows what they might do? i certainly don't. but we're talking.
6254	none	@limbclock i wouldn't do that.
6255	none	@Spacekatgal it was to get the userbase. and we all know how fbook loves to do social experiments with data.
6256	none	"I like how GG took TB's statement at http://t.co/6ADOWhlZfb to mean ""just hide the harassment in another subreddit"""
6257	none	@Spacekatgal twitter allows 13 yr olds. 13 yr olds don't generally have bank accts. *lots* of people don't have bank accts/work in cash.
6258	none	Oh god. I am so stubborn.  Just realized the only thing it took to push me off the fence in the real name/pseudonym debate was jason/wadhwa.
6259	none	@WestCoastAnime @ChrisWarcraft NOOOOOOOOOOOO BEY I AM SO SORRY. YOU ARE STILL A NATIONAL TREASURE.
6260	none	@tomdcc multiple gmail accts. this is all a lot of effort  though. most trolls just pick a new target.
6261	none	so  my yammering sleazeball cupcakes  you can go with http://t.co/TDToqiuQDc and i'll go my way.  I fight for the users.
6262	none	@Spacekatgal $1 may not seem that far out of reach to a lot of people in the US  but we're also far removed from the class it would impact.
6263	none	@Spacekatgal 80% of his points are bullshit taken from white cis male standpoint. no harassment on fbook? pft. providing ID/addy? NOPE.
6264	none	@limbclock if you only want 3 people to use it.
6265	none	RT @journodave: 'As Beck stepped up to take his album of the year award' what is this? 1997?
6266	none	nichegamer got blacklisted by a gaming company. they responded by posting an article friday night about being blacklisted. oh boy.
6267	none	@GlennF only if you want to laugh at how fucking privileged he is. what a tool.
6268	none	Pretty sure that @ChrisWarcraft and I can take credit for Beck's comeback.
6269	none	@sschinke @tomdcc that exists in web.
6270	none	@tomdcc oh god that sounds like a horrible idea. privacy problems. also  twitter likely wouldn't be storing the number. that would be bad.
6271	none	YES. I LOVE @lenadunham. http://t.co/ycgTBmmdxb
6272	none	however  twitter clients and web are supposed to have the same tools/exp. that's why devpolicy doesn't really encourage 3rd party clients.
6273	none	@teh_maxh you don't have to have a phone to get SMS. you have to have internet. which is also required for twitter.
6274	none	@GemmaNoon it's really fun watching patterns emerge in all of this regarding various groups. i think it'll be useful.
6275	none	@eDRoaCH i think we shouldn't make assumptions if they are used in this manner  which is diff from their original purpose.
6276	none	@TheQuinnspiracy @ChrisWarcraft get crazy with the cheese whiz.
6277	none	countdown to more companies following suit after seeing the way that was handled.
6278	none	@GlennF @Spacekatgal he's regurgitating the same ideas that people have had before. they were bad then  shockingly  still bad now.
6279	none	@sschinke @teh_maxh what are you talking about?
6280	none	@sschinke @TsundereRager the latest version doesn't take this into account  iirc. i just added it to my custom bot blacklist.
6281	none	verified accounts have features that other accounts do not. not sure what kind of overhead increasing that # would have.
6282	none	@GlennF @Spacekatgal it is rather funny how all of us are so completely different  yet complement each other's skill sets so well.
6283	none	@GemmaNoon rather amused that despite their protests  GG is the only group i've looked at where abuse is easily predicted based on followers
6284	none	add a filter to toggle showing phone-verified accts in clients (requires devpolicy update  natch).
6285	none	@MaxwellTolvo @Spacekatgal they don't do this right now. i mean  unless you are becoming verified.
6286	none	@tomdcc a lot of people don't have cell phones. i was one of them for 2 years. ;) i only used GV. against the idea of disallowing GV.
6287	none	@sschinke @TsundereRager automated programs  whatever. it's not clearly written.
6288	none	I think we really need to talk about these  too: http://t.co/T1ZmOfLf9A
6289	none	"don't worry  i'm sure no one will be like ""WHAT A GREAT IDEA"" until a dude takes credit for it. &lt;3"
6290	none	@sschinke @TsundereRager Unclear. ToS prevents bots from being able to contact you without you contacting them first  iirc.
6291	none	@sschinke @teh_maxh it sets a bad precedent.
6292	none	@eDRoaCH i've seen some strong proof that people in the middle east are using online solutions for SMS.
6293	none	@Spacekatgal it makes sense to ask for donations to keep it up and going  and to pay for the dev work. ideally  this is 100% crowd-funded.
6294	none	it is really not at all surprising to me that wadhwa and jason are both promoting a solution that removes pseudonymity.
6295	none	@dylanw last i checked  baldwin was verified.
6296	none	*gag* https://t.co/R4seYFa5s8 #stopwadhwa2015
6297	none	in short  there needs to be a verified that isn't Verified. requiring govt ids will cause probs. unique phone less problematic  not perfect.
6298	none	@tomdcc accepting pull requests for better ideas that don't violate pseudonymity/privacy. &lt;3
6299	none	@spacequeentbh so faded. :P need a hair cut + dye desperately.
6300	none	@Spacekatgal and businesses often pay for solutions like that. i have no problem charging businesses  just individuals.
6301	none	"RT @randi_ebooks: I speak for ""go fuck yourself  you don't get to choose my priorities  buttpirate."""
6302	none	does have some drawbacks. but a 2nd toggle saying 'show me accts older than N days' is easy. metadata already exists. client/policy update.
6303	none	@teh_maxh still extra work to go through. most trolls move on and find new victims.
6304	none	fellow sockphiles: http://t.co/gVSIbpITFL
6305	none	the ability to lock a unique phone # to your account already exists. eng/infra is already there. expose if a # has been added via metadata.
6306	none	@sschinke @TsundereRager previous versions of ebooks_example (code using twitter_ebooks) wouldn't reply to *_ebooks accounts.
6307	none	@RachelLite oh  they are. they didn't hurt after the first day or two.
6308	none	@g_worroll @AmyDentata i'm not your manager!
6309	none	Hey  guys. We can totes hax them by submitting a pull request with some XSS cleverly disguised... in a perl CLI app. http://t.co/qzvtl1h7SS
6310	none	@seanbonner i'm trying to have a conversation. why do you think it's a fight?
6311	none	@seanbonner just because i disagree with you doesn't mean i have strong feelings about you. i just dislike your solution.
6312	none	Woman dev audience. I think the real msg I want to get across is that anyone can make a difference. Even with just a 200 line perl script.
6313	none	@TcherylT yup. I know the drill.
6314	none	@seanbonner @metsfan anything that requires a government ID is a privacy concern. anything that requires money is a bad idea forever.
6315	none	@sibbysoyabean isn't everyone?
6316	none	@RaikonL he might actually listen... or probably not. unless your twitter userid is low.
6317	none	@Cleon my code could have been compressed to half the size :P I go for readability.
6318	none	Given that he already used his low twitter userid to brag about his worth  I shouldn't be shocked that he wants twitter to be classist.
6319	none	@jurijuri that was one of the few grownup movies I saw as a kid. Those 3 breasts  they stuck with me forever. Never forget.
6320	none	RT @coil780: @freebsdgirl which is what GG doesn't get  either. Not even about them  it's about harassment. They jst insist it's not real/b…
6321	none	It's tough deciding how much of my personal story to relate when giving a short keynote about the present state of anti-harassment efforts.
6322	none	"also  lol at ""senior position"" - because it's an employer with titles  apparently. // @freebsd"
6323	none	Sometimes I hope that CA does break off and become it's own island. I love it here  but damn. The system is rigged.
6324	none	A peace treaty is brokered. Google reverts search to include porn and adds a new Google API for Cats as a Service. The world rejoices.
6325	none	@mikeage what isn't? ;P
6326	none	I've seen the mod claim that I doxxed them  but I have no idea who they even are. Screencap in case deleted. http://t.co/rDLrReymVg
6327	none	@seanbonner I was mostly with you  until you started talking about charging a fee. This is a horrible idea.
6328	none	@a_man_in_black you can't mute hashtags. that's a violation of twitter developer policy  which is why it's only implemented in older clients
6329	none	FreeBSD is in fact a person. Yo  @freebsd  you hear about this? Why are we not besties anymore? http://t.co/ZmofIOEHSQ
6330	none	@j4cob congrats.
6331	none	It's like Frozen  if snow was IPv6 evangelism.
6332	none	@cooperq fwiw  i never quite disagreed completely. i'm pretty good at fence sitting.
6333	none	@seanbonner A low userid doesn't give you any special insight from atop a pulpit of privilege. abuse-free living shouldn't have a premium.
6334	none	.@bryneaux I prefer just getting up on stage and speaking  but most conference organizers want me to have slides. ;)

6339	none	"find the problems w/dude's solution  don't publicly call him out  get accused of ""trying to pick a fight"" when i ask him about it. SHOCKING."

6438	none	@dylanw I don't know him. I don't know if he acts that way with everyone. I only can base my opinion off that single exp &amp; his blog post.
6439	none	It's super common to run into an unintentional DoS  especially in dev. Ever make a stupid mistake that caused a critical lack of resources?

6442	none	@DHStom d'awww. I FEEL LIKE WONDER WOMAN.
6443	none	I don't understand why a simple technical definition is giving them so much of a problem. They seem to think DoS/DDoS == excessive packets.
6444	none	Lord save me from the hurt feelings of men in tech whose ideas have been challenged.
6445	none	@dylanw i'm not responsible for his hurt feelings when he's the one that decided to ignore me instead of having a conversation.

6450	none	@coconono there's no hard definition of what constitutes DoS beyond lack of service. Service is open to mean many things.
6451	none	DoS/DDoS doesn't refer to a technique or method of transport.  It's largely defined by intention + end result.  This is not rocket surgery.
6452	none	@jeremiahfelt those are waaaaay more spendy. this is the drive i have. just considering using built-in or if i should go software.
6453	none	@MechMK1 why would you do that? :P these lectures are about freebsd.
6454	none	@cptmashek if the only devs standing up are the ones that haven't made mistakes  all devs should be sitting down. ;)
6455	none	@atonal440 *sigh*. why are so many people bad at understanding what DoS is.
6456	none	@SrslyJosh perf isn't a concern. It's mostly going to be backups and document storage.

6463	none	@IamStan is bitlocker any good? i've never used it. didn't realize i could gpg an entire drive  either. :)
6464	none	@dylanw i get that you're probably going to defend your friend regardless  but what he did was shitty  and then you followed it w/more shit.
6465	none	@dylanw you may claim otherwise  but I really don't think he and I are on the same side at *all*.

6521	none	@milfgaardian I usually mix brands depending on how they fade. SFX has fantastic pinks  though. N'Rage does some decent pinks  too.

6523	none	@ElisaRockDoc works well for some colors. the pastels are gorgeous but fade SUPER quickly. the blues are amazing.

6529	none	@stubbornella eep. :(
6530	none	I mean  why would GamerGate care about a video where people read the abusive tweets they've received? What does this have to do with ethics?
6531	none	@MinorAnnoyance @JimmyKimmelLive yup.
6532	none	@sschinke not sure. i think this could be too easily argued irt if attacks can be unintentional.
6533	none	That was fun. Now it's over. This is why I can't even consider sites like TechRaptr as anything more than hit piece blogs.
6534	none	@Spacekatgal yes. And if you can RT and request others targeted do the same  that would be rad. Hoping for 10+ examples.
6535	none	@youfoundthecard @ChrisWarcraft um. that's BASIC. DOS has batch files  but they aren't BASIC. :P

6559	none	@argonblue my perl is pretty readable. not as efficient  necessarily  but definitely possible for anyone to read &amp; understand.
6560	none	@milfgaardian pravana blue - NOT pastels - mixed with a touch of purple to make the fade gorgeous + pravana clear. i swear by it.

6593	none	Out of Pravana blue. Guess I'm stuck with mixing some clear with Special FX Turquoise to layer over existing hair. hmm. This might be good.
6594	none	@Jules_Clarke @jmcefalas has more emotional impact when it's the face of a person reading it out loud.
6595	none	@kencf0618 Being blocked isn't harassment.

6597	none	@youfoundthecard @ChrisWarcraft I'm not as young as you think I am :P

6638	none	@SamanthaZeitlin I'm about to wander outside and enjoy the sun for a few minutes.

6701	none	So  Supernova is continuing to not respond to my facebook post  but the gaters are piling on. Interesting. Is the con run by GG supporter?
6702	none	Most tellingly of all  hashtag + target mentions are up. @spacekatgal has received 474 mentions in the past 12 hours w/gamergate ht.
6703	none	@ThatTonyG @ChrisWarcraft I would but my time is super limited these next few days. I'm about to have to run  too many meetings.
6704	none	You've got to be fucking kidding me. @halletecco @wadhwa @Jason
6705	none	Step 1: post to facebook. Step 2: KiA links to it. Step 3: Get dog-piled by GamerGate w/accusations of animal abuse  https://t.co/UK7KuSe1oa
6706	none	vomit. #stopwadhwa2015 http://t.co/78tLSv56cs
6707	none	@DennisCEarl well  given that vivek got an article pulled  it likely has something to do with them being in support of free speech.
6708	none	Typically mine are fairly low. They dropped especially when they realized I wasn't bothering to engage many blocked users.
6709	none	In response to Supernova continuing to allow Adam Baldwin as a guest. http://t.co/RqJIlgfZVL
6710	none	Watching @wadhwa completely dismiss women that don't agree with him  be very disappointed in men that don't agree with him. #stopwadhwa2015.
6711	none	@theRoUS done.
6712	none	"@AGoodHusband @ArsVampyre however  despite what they want everyone to believe  speaking out about your experiences isn't ""harassing"" GG."
6713	none	@DiceTechJobs @Itshella_dom @Maira_Benjamin @jenrpetersen that isn't me.
6714	none	@MadcapOcelot it's beyond what i am capable of doing.
6715	none	@LiamPomfret I refuse to provide proof to any of those nutters. It won't make any difference. They just claim it's faked or defend it.
6716	none	@M_Wein congrats ^.^
6717	none	@DennisCEarl it was a podcast given by a woman in tech about how she doesn't want him to speak for her.
6718	none	@cxarli glad it helped :)
6719	none	@ilovegarick probably not. i can't really afford to go to conferences that i'm not speaking at. :(
6720	none	On that Supernova facebook thread. Hoooooooly shit.
6721	none	Lots of love for @femfreq  @spacekatgal  @TheQuinnspiracy. I can't imagine how hard that was for them to watch. How violated they feel.
6722	none	@AGoodHusband @ArsVampyre harassing and doxxing prevent free speech. they are an attempt to silence their targets.
6723	none	Sorry about all the RTs  but this is a really serious issue. This guy is basically the tech anti-feminist that thinks he's an ally.
6724	none	@girlziplocked @Jason hahaha yams
6725	none	"In regards to being harassed by GamerGate  i was just told: ""Let your experience better you as a woman instead of seeking sympathy."""
6726	none	Important to note in ALL of these stats  my 'before' is taken from a large timespan. 'after' has been the past 12 h  typically a slow time.
6727	none	Looking at GG hashtag  they were averaging abt 517 tweets/30m before #LawAndOrderSVU. Now  1032.48/30m.
6728	none	@MadcapOcelot I think @ameliagreenhall did that in her first blog post about him. Doing it programmatically is *really* hard.

6740	none	@albertinho thank you for making the petition. ^.^

6743	none	@Quinnae_Moon @KaitlynBurnell it did feel like there wasn't much point to it other than ratings. a quick win based on current controversy.
6744	none	On the other hand  I think it had value. Maybe. I can only hope that law enforcement watches that show. *sigh*
6745	none	don't try to turn this into an immigration issue. we could care less where he's from. we don't want him to speak for us. @triggerasaurus
6746	none	I just watched #LawAndOrderSVU. It was... distressing. Corny early in the ep  but then... jesus.
6747	none	RT @wadhwa: @kurtopsahl But for someone who touts EFF on their twitter account  you are being rather judgmental--are you not?

6757	none	Sorry to disappoint  but I think I'm already a pretty awesome women. A low self-esteem continues to not be an issue.
6758	none	@mattjbaldo yup!
6759	none	@theRoUS oops. i just woke up from a nap. ;P
6760	none	Leaning in isn't a bad solution. It's just not the *only* solution. It's expecting women to solve all the problems.

7405	none	@arthur_affect ONE OF US. ONE OF US.
7406	none	No  I'm not telling anyone what their score is. Then it'll just turn into a contest for GamerGate to try to 'win'.
7407	none	OK  look. Someone is messaging me on something. I hear the ding. I don't know which account  which service  which computer. Uh. DM me.
7408	none	@1Life0Continues users you're following along with their troll score plays a factor. users you RT  % of tweets that are sea lioning
7409	none	plz stop posting pics of me that i posted a few weeks ago. i care so much about what people think of my appearance. it's what i live for.
7410	none	RT @jneen_: @freebsdgirl http://t.co/iate9b6AoX
7411	none	@PsychoSix @PolitiBunny not really. i blocked her. someone that likes to sick nutballs on people?
7412	none	It was incredibly fucking difficult to type that.
7413	none	That guy kept going for a while  too. I think he proposed. Are we married now? Does this mean I have health insurance?
7414	none	@1Life0Continues i've got the code to interpret &amp; analyze  but the weights themselves are going to take a lot of fiddling.
7415	none	Oh  darling MRAs. You making jabs at my appearance won't keep me from working to provide tools so others can shut you down. &lt;3
7416	none	But I guess you're not really sure how to react when a woman has resources to help others fight back. Such a quandary. So perplexing. :\
7417	none	@RealityForger CA has some interesting ways of getting around jurisdiction issues. Still researching other states.
7418	none	@lieutfaber &lt;3
7419	none	@desertfox899 woops!
7420	none	@CafeChatNoir i think it's because i'm too tired to have feelings.
7421	none	@Trigger_Check the guy who paid.
7422	none	@TeeYouVee i don't mind bickering  but with some  it feels like kicking puppies. i'm anti-puppy kicking.
7423	none	hey guys  the MRAs found me. oh noes. whatever will I do as a damsel in distress? oh gosh. plz stop. such a hapless victim.
7424	none	Please stop with all of the karma/negative comments. There's a bigger issue here than the person that was targeted.
7425	none	Possibly respond to some support requests with canned answers.
7426	none	The current system is inadequate. Some of us are experienced at navigating these pitfalls  and we can help you.

7428	none	@davidsgallant weird.
7429	none	@slagkick oh  yeah. i spam the hell out of those buttons.
7430	none	I'm not going to say I told you so. However  I will say that you'll probably see this  and you know my email address if you need help.
7431	none	In many states  we've got laws that specifically protect against this kind of thing. However  they aren't enforced due to education/funding.
7432	none	I doubt he'll bother emailing  but despite his past actions  no one should have to deal with shit like this.
7433	none	@markemer I love perl  but I think I'm starting to shift towards ruby. gem is nice. docs are horrid. need to read more about classes.
7434	none	A lot of you are new followers since November  so I think this bears a reshare. My story: http://t.co/SUrQwclIoU http://t.co/fDdPhD6JAO
7435	none	@Nibelsnarfabarf @srhbutts @GRIMACHU it is really funny all the assumptions they make about how it works - and how much they are wrong.
7436	none	@jonrosenberg just checking. :)
7437	none	@jneen_ i need to know the story behind that image

7440	none	@Chickowits @Trigger_Check most seem to think god is literally talking to them. i'm... not fond of those.
7441	none	"Isn't it supposed to be ""keep emailing"" :P  (via https://t.co/YshEHFHMFm) http://t.co/V1hMUj1tTr"
7442	none	@RealityForger if your friend needs help knowing how to talk to police  prevention  etc  they should talk to @CrashOverrideNW or myself. :)
7443	none	@markemer ruby. :P  perl doesn't have a good module for streaming API. forced me to get better at ruby! @sferik does good stuff.
7444	none	I know of at least 3 people that are dealing with police today after being doxxed on 8chan. Trying to be available if I'm needed.
7445	none	@funjon that's... actually kind of interesting. i'll give them a call later next week. i need to talk to them anyways.
7446	none	@AndreaFaulds @ggautoblocker it's true  there's a risk. but the same risk is involved in just following the twitter account.
7447	none	@Llydisblur hoping it's momentary and not a trend. i've not been able to vote repub in a while.
7448	none	i don't know because i had everyone else on that thread blocked. but i'm am loling so hard right now.
7449	none	See https://t.co/VHThRdRIYr thread for more info on how this is quantified.

7454	none	When the most you've got to throw at me is tweeting insults  you don't really have any weapon at all.
7455	none	@brx0 @1Life0Continues that's why there are *many* factors. :P  matching 1 or 2 variables is expected.
7456	none	Have 2 team members  sticking with this for now. Thanks  everyone. ^.^
7457	none	she must not realize that blocking people is sorrrrrta what i'm famous for.
7458	none	Sipping coffee  pulling down follower list  running analytics against each of them to create a troll score.

7461	none	RT @randi_ebooks: This guy thinks I'm Randi Harper  have we met?
7462	none	Looking at comments marked as abuse on my site.  That must be the problem! I have a hostile womb. http://t.co/eTGWAY6vHM
7463	none	lol  that chick from last night is still raging about me blocking her  i guess.
7464	none	@slagkick i have no idea what my rotation is. honestly i'm just hitting buttons and topping damage meters in bgs with a fresh 100.
7465	none	I used to have pet bunnies. :)  I named them POSIX and ANSI.
7466	none	@Shjade @Trigger_Check http://t.co/W8z9y2J42x
7467	none	Yesterday  a dude that SWATed someone admitted that GamerGate - more specifically  someone on the GamerGate sourcelist - paid them to do so.
7468	none	I've posted a contact form at http://t.co/4S8Ug3bBUC for support regarding @ggautoblocker  speaking requests  feedback  etc.
7469	none	@cxarli it was private messages.
7470	none	@emily_esque I would love that. would you mind DMing me your email address? can shoot you an email later today.
7471	none	@alex SO GROSS. feeling the urge to shower in boiling water.

7478	none	@Vodage @PendragonTarot gamergate isn't really sjws? it's for people that don't want to get notifications from gamergaters.
7479	none	@eevee HI WANT TO GET DRINKS
7480	none	@ShriekAPotomos @CrashOverrideNW someone else - which means people are actively searching her name  which is still creepy.
7481	none	@Keltounet http://t.co/g7w5b4uSbW
7482	none	@CALMicC wary isn't the same thing as condemnation. :)
7483	none	@gewt @SFtheWolf mine is definitely usable. :) i quite like it. stand is kind of meh  but the device itself works fine.
7484	none	@JohnDoty sometimes. :P  i try.
7485	none	@bibulb @Vodage please untag me from all of this. it's spamming my notifications.
7486	none	This is a criminal case  not a civil case. This means that it's up to the police to decide if it's worth prosecuting. @PendragonTarot
7487	none	@CALMicC in the right circumstances  I'm a lot more tolerant and understanding than many would believe.
7488	none	Nachoshield is getting a bit quieter again.
7489	none	@LarryWest42 mostly joan jett lyrics.
7490	none	@Shake_Well that's likely the same person i'm talking about.
7491	none	@Vodage @GameNinja08 @KaitlynBurnell ah  okay.
7492	none	If someone has had a crime committed personally against them online  the police aren't likely to listen to anyone BUT them. @PendragonTarot
7493	none	RT @PendragonTarot: @freebsdgirl Ok  name the person who paid the SWATer. If your claim holds up  they'll be dealt with. #GamerGate
7494	none	@chilblane no one from requiem ever goes. they are too antisocial.
7495	none	@delfuego @PendragonTarot TIL I'm the district attorney.
7496	none	I'd love to see how twitter determines gender &amp; interests when doing targeted ads. guessing it's not something like bluekai.
7497	none	@chilblane everyone should be jealous of my coffee maker. our love is pure.
7498	none	Frankly  I have more legal and tech resources than a hashtag. Plese go spew your hate group propaganda elsewhere. @PendragonTarot
7499	none	@Animecommentary only when it counts. i'm pretty snarky when it's not serious times  you know?
7500	none	@voretaq7 @chilblane uh  it's also pink  which makes the coffee taste better.
7501	none	@benoithamelin thank you. ^.^
7502	none	sigh. I need to work on building out my legal contacts to encompass more states.
7503	none	Aw. I was talking to a gater on reddit for the past few weeks. He seemed nice enough  but he just deleted his account. :\  come back dude.
7504	none	@grumpybozo ah hah!
7505	none	@gewt @SFtheWolf try $35. :P
7506	none	@Jen_X_Infinity i know that feel.
7507	none	@Charmieos @PendragonTarot *We* can't take any action other than offering advice and assistance. Person targeted has to report it to police.
7508	none	@eevee WE CAN TWEET EACH OTHER IN ALL CAPS WHILE WE ARE AT THE PUB IF THAT'S YOUR THING
7509	none	@GlennF not sure. sounds like he left for good.
7510	none	@Jen_X_Infinity @ShriekAPotomos @CrashOverrideNW hi. i still saw your tweet. one  i'm female. obviously. two  this isn't helping.
7511	none	It doesn't surprise me that GG has turned my offer of help for one of their own into a reason to screech at me  but it's still irritating.
7512	none	As a reminder  assistance requests are private. You can be anon  but I need to know situation  pref w/location. PGP: http://t.co/NwgZLY9G6r
7513	none	@TheRealVordox I'm not linking doxx.
7514	none	"So please take your accusations of ""WHY AREN'T YOU PROSECUTING  EVIL ANTIGG SCUM"" and go educate yourself. @PendragonTarot"
7515	none	@CALMicC he kept me informed on stuff id missed and seemed ok. I liked him.
7516	none	@grumpybozo i'm tired and confused - have been up too long. that isn't my IP.
7517	none	If you're in trouble  I recommend using @CrashOverrideNW. I can also help provide assistance.
7518	none	@ShriekAPotomos @CrashOverrideNW As to if I'm working with her  that's none of your business. This isn't an adequate use of your time. Shoo.
7519	none	@chilblane yo  you planning on going to blizzcon this year?
7520	none	@DARKDUME I said it in 2014  too. Likely 2013  2012  2011. Might want to attribute all the years.
7521	none	@MetroidThief i'm bothered by the attitude from every poster in that thread in general. but i might just be grumpy.
7522	none	oh god oh god oh god never point a microscope at skin
7523	none	@RealityForger @BattleAxe2015 @CrashOverrideNW twitter isn't really optimal for long conversations.
7524	none	@Jeff_Nacht it's not pink.
7525	none	@SFtheWolf http://t.co/g7w5b4uSbW is the one I got. If you get it  don't install their drivers. Just use default webcam drivers.
7526	none	I'm going to cut in here - despite blocking you - to explain something that seems to confuse many people. @PendragonTarot
7527	none	@Animecommentary everyone is awkward. :P  most people think they are most awkward than they really are. you're fine.
7528	none	@sarahjeong this is mostly what i need. interesting to see that some states don't have statues on both.
7529	none	The sweetest love story. A FreeBSDGirl and her coffee maker. http://t.co/b6wu4eN7V0
7530	none	@sarahjeong well  that just made my life much easier. :P
7531	none	"Sorry  I don't believe in GamerGate's version of justice. Mass reporting isn't ""dealing with"" anything. @PendragonTarot"
7532	none	@ThatSabineGirl &lt;3  i can't imagine how hard it is. let me know if there's anything you want me to promote  any help that i can give.
7533	none	@jbradfield that's  ah  all of my kitchen  really. i have a thing for english tea roses patterns  too.
7534	none	@GameNinja08 @Vodage @KaitlynBurnell i have no idea wtf is going on or why i am mentioned in this tweet.
7535	none	@AgQueue @PendragonTarot noted. I'll put it on the list of accounts to kick further up the chain.
7536	none	@Vodage @KaitlynBurnell I have no idea what this tweet is in reply to.
7537	none	@sarahjeong that would be awesome. &lt;3
7538	none	This is not legal advice. but common sense. What I can do is help people know what to say to police or help find a lawyer. @PendragonTarot
7539	none	@ultimape not quite yet as far as tooling goes  although i've been thinking about facebook. i've been working with many companies  though.
7540	none	@sarahjeong i'm envious of your education. :P  knowing how to interpret some things seems tricky  to say the least.
7541	none	@TeeYouVee sweet. no one has used this yet  and there appears to be somewhat of a delay. watching to see when it goes through.
7542	none	@Shake_Well what he did was wrong and should be prosecuted. however  he's now been doxxed and targeted as well. it's a clusterfuck.
7543	none	@TheRealVordox oh  i see. you're another useless GG supporter. lol. go away.
7544	none	hashtag nachoshield hashtag goobergrape http://t.co/5Mz1rwp3bY
7545	none	I don't comment on who I might be helping  and I'm not here to pass judgement on anyone's activities.
7546	none	@DegenerateBoy @scalzi that's not funny.
7547	none	@sarahjeong searching for &amp; reading each state's penal codes individually is tedious.
7548	none	Several people have pointed out http://t.co/nr1da7c7rJ WHERE WERE YOU WHEN I NEEDED YOU FOR LIFE ADVICE  XKCD? http://t.co/1mZFXmRlEu
7549	none	@EvvyKube yup!
7550	none	@Animecommentary aw  thanks. ;)
7551	none	@voretaq7 @chilblane i'm sorry. :(
7552	none	@CALMicC I think that this person didn't like some of the behavior  too. Perhaps why they deleted their account.
7553	none	@Andrew_Cybulska weird. guessing that she'll be back. i don't really understand why people delete their accts vs just closing twitter app.
7554	none	"Telling me ""DON'T HELP THIS PERSON  THEY ARE NOT REALLY VICTIMS"" probs isn't going to get you the reaction for which you are looking."
7555	none	@RealityForger @BattleAxe2015 @CrashOverrideNW shot her an email.
