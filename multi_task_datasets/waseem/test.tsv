8434	none	One of my least favorite things is sending an abuse complaint into the void of a ticketing system and waiting for a human. We can do better.
8435	none	@SuperSpacedad most of tech doesn't really know about gamergate and doesn't care. In a bigger sense  gamergate has no importance.
8436	none	@root_tim this is my work :)
8437	none	Oh my god. @christinelove is ADORABLE. I have a crush. #gameloading

8476	none	@fdgonthier @Patreon thanks! ;)
8477	none	@Professor_D anything i say publicly gets quoted by the press. randi@randi.io.
8478	none	@drurbanski @trentmkays i've just seen way to many abuse preventatives lately that suggest some sort of pay wall. can't get behind that.
8479	none	@ashleylynch I'll keep that in mind. :) At some point  I could see it going there - but not on our roadmap for at least 9-12 months.
8480	none	@drurbanski @trentmkays i'm pushing more for these to be options added by twitter or using free scripts.

8486	none	@Skawtnyc @athenahollow @twoscooters please stop including me in that post. I use it for reference  but I used to live with her  and we
8487	none	@mistertodd hoping we'll be able to release more info soon. :) Lots of stuff in the works. I promise big things.
8488	none	@em_zyme @nvidiadeveloper @YahooGames @TwitchSupport same. I recently bought their kingpin card. I always buy nvidia.
8489	none	@BrianHallDev @sindarina not fond of the idea of creating features with a money barrier.
8490	none	@juliaferraioli purchased from sock dreams  sadly. :P
8491	none	@sschinke it's entertaining  but well... let's just say my entire next week is quickly filling with meetings. no time for gamergate. :)
8492	none	RT @parisba: A #GamerGate fan attending #GDC15 lists all they don't like about the industry. It seems to be all the good things? http://t.c…
8493	none	@sigje tempting. i &lt;3 chef community so much  but given my focus is moving away from devops  seems like funds should go to someone else. :P
8494	none	@ashleylynch @mistertodd read the last line of the paragraph about OAPI out loud to a table full of indie devs at dinner tonight. LOVE IT.
8495	none	A lot of indie game devs remind me a LOT of FOSS devs. It's all about that passion. I'm drawn to passion. Kind of in love with all of them.
8496	none	@FingerLicknGod #NachoShield is my favorite. :)
8497	none	@DataFran i have other experiences that are not fine from the standpoint of being an ex-volunteer.
8498	none	@mattjbaldo that's never a problem.
8499	none	@WackoMedia http://t.co/2AXPNlSIkg
8500	none	@fdgonthier a lot of people contribute just a little bit  and it turns into enough to keep me afloat. every dollar is immensely appreciated.
8501	none	@Questionor that is a lot harder. developer policy prohibits it.
8502	none	@dominictarason @twoscooters @Official_PAX @ShaofHappiness wait. which enforcer.

8506	none	@mcclure111 eek (also hi  i followed you because you're awesome. &lt;3)
8507	none	@cwalker built-in would be good. i can do more with 3rd party services than i can by providing a client  in the meanwhile.
8508	none	@srhbutts @snipeyhead yeah. it was pretty accurate. I don't see why that dude thought that these were bad things.
8509	none	@ashleylynch o_O   that's appreciated greatly. going to be releasing some financial info soon.

8513	none	I got some insight into the indie gaming community tonight. Just a peek. It was enlightening.
8514	none	@nite_moogle (p.s. blizzard makes the best games)
8515	none	RT @jcherkis: Thanks @Pahlkadot for the great talk  @Microsoft about digital government and @codeforamerica http://t.co/QmD7Ql5qQb
8516	none	@EvvyKube it is absurd how much of my amazon wish list consists of socks.
8517	none	RT @srhbutts: women at GDC share heartbreaking stories. this is how #gamergate chooses to respond. http://t.co/Q7aBw89VqN

8519	none	@juliaferraioli hahaha  my favorite thing ever is shopping for fun socks. :)
8520	none	then i got sick  but i have work to do. solution? i just went out and bought a 6 lb brisket. All problems can be solved with more meat.
8521	none	@sschinke honestly? i forgot his name. :P doesn't really matter. i'm working with real data scientists.
8522	none	GG has already started flooding the IRS  proving that they have no idea that it is impossible to get the IRS to do what you want them to do.
8523	none	@sigje ooo. i might actually do that.
8524	none	@glassresistor @thereaIbanksy ewwww. i saw this on my phone  so didn't see the salvation army logo.
8525	none	@melissagira i'm also quite curious about this  and wondering about the radio silence from @Jeff_Skalski
8526	none	Sickened but not surprised by what happened at PAX earlier today. PAX has a history of making poor decisions at the cost of women's safety.
8527	none	GDC was great today. Thank you for letting me be a small part of your world. But it's time to (literally) take off my cape and go to bed. :)
8528	none	No. https://t.co/vpiOhlNGFy
8529	none	@dunno_someguy i love &amp; support sex workers. am friends with many.
8530	none	@kencf0618 awesome! :D
8531	none	OK  yeah. No GDC today. Coughing. Too much to do next week  can't risk full-blown ConSARS.
8532	none	Since I'm joining the startup scene  it seems like a bad thing that I'm looking forward to season 2 of Silicon Valley. But it looks SO GOOD.
8533	none	Here's an idea. How about the ability to mute someone for N period of time?
8534	none	Need a way to switch btwn sets of tabs. Have a bunch of tabs open for a WoW addon I'm writing that creates goog calendar for garrison.
8535	none	@bradjgreer ooo  i like that.
8536	none	@ChrisWarcraft yo  check out http://t.co/qqXxu6seI0. It has helped me SO MUCH with eyestrain.
8537	none	@ejrtairne @Phoenix_Blue blocked you? i thought she blocked someone else.
8538	none	how do i even have an ear ache i am not 4
8539	none	@cwalker iirc  tweetbot is a paid app. :)  i'm not necessarily thinking full-fledged client.
8540	none	@elplatt i'm mostly pondering a few startup incubators that are now accepting non-profit applications.
8541	none	That was a comment taken from Polygon's article on the #1RTB panel. http://t.co/v5yK2J14ko
8542	none	So it would auto-unmute after N hours  or whatever.
8543	none	Seeing a lot of talk about GDC vs PAX. I felt safer at GDC post-GamerGate than I did at PAX pre-GamerGate. So  there's that.
8544	none	@Skawtnyc @athenahollow @twoscooters are not exactly on speaking terms.

8552	none	@athenahollow i've been mostly ignoring it  but she's clearly fixated and making weird accusations. has never once directly talked to me.
8553	none	@athenahollow i'm a monogamous girl in a polygamous world.
8554	none	@Robobengt also a few famous people followed me and now i'm freaking out that i tweet too much &amp; don't want to scare them off. :P
8555	none	@tmclaughbos i think i had him muted because he was misconfigured to randomly tweet at me. :P
8556	none	@mattstratton ok. whenever you've calmed yourself  poke me on facebook and i'll tell you why it's a problem w/the code base.
8557	none	I am sorry  journalists  but this is kind of a place for me to just vent. &gt;.&gt; i like you  i really do  but not for this. &lt;3
8558	none	@hypatiadotca @GlennF but does it scale?
8559	none	@mcclure111 it's minimum wage. This started happening about 4 years ago  I think.
8560	none	@DoctorAvenue selfies are rad. ^.^
8561	none	@drskyskull @jvdgoot @srhbutts ok - i have to say that i at least love how they are sticking to the correct pronoun.

8564	none	@tmclaughbos now i have to login to randi_ebooks and add him to the bot base blacklist. so uh  thanks for that.

8567	none	@mattstratton @cigardubey yeah  it's pretty rad for managing multiple accounts in various services.
8568	none	@mumbly_joe @Funkyrefresh @superspacedad @glinner im sorry wat http://t.co/Q8hSwCYvem
8569	none	I'm watching Enforcers say that they knew it was only a matter of time until this happened. Still  nothing was done.
8570	none	@jsigj @SuperSpacedad @Glinner that's his original account  renamed.
8571	none	I started putting pocky through my lip rings. That seems reasonable. http://t.co/XtRP05leDk
8572	none	@JWYoder i got spells for that.
8573	none	@JWYoder @athenahollow meh. i have a couple of pathfinder modules  but it's not really my thing.
8574	none	Guests use my Aria. I get emails w/their weight. Sometimes  when we're playing card games  I'll silently mouth the number at them. I win.
8575	none	@athenahollow that was my intention. :P
8576	none	@athenahollow no doubt. i don't really have the time for lawsuits  so it's a question of resource allocation vs benefit.
8577	none	totally got the flag. #selfie #warlords http://t.co/7i4pBDn2n9
8578	none	@mattstratton @tmclaughbos so it causes problems with other bots. :\
8579	none	@pinefoxi matcha
8580	none	@athenahollow YOU ARE MARRIED YOUNG MISS GO HITHER
8581	none	@tmclaughbos don't do dumbass things. i kicked the bot.
8582	none	@Robobengt this one is more official-ish. less tweets  i think. i'm still figuring out my role as CEO &amp; keeping normal persona.
8583	none	"@hypatiadotca @GlennF i almost typed ""is it in the cloud"" forgetting that i have keyboard input word replace for cloud to butt."
8584	none	@mattstratton @tmclaughbos it's not internet rules. it's the way the code is written...
8585	none	@Glinner @ashleylynch @SuperSpacedad revenge porn dude is hilarious if you listen to him. he thinks large tech companies shouldn't exist.
8586	none	@athenahollow but on the other hand  it sends a message. and i'm not used to having to be concerned about an org's image vs my own.
8587	none	@dominictarason @SuperSpacedad @Glinner if you talk to people  it's called collusion  not conversation. get it right.
8588	none	@cortanav yo  you're enforcing at PAX this year  right? can you find a person? https://t.co/uKxe6fVVfc

8592	none	My bot. http://t.co/idYkZ3Eb30
8593	none	@M_Wein i still don't understand the whole white knight things. knights get land  armor  sword  horse. who wouldn't want this? LAND IN SF?!
8594	none	There's one particular person that has tweeted about me more than 40 times in the past 12 hours. This has been her pattern for the &gt;1 week.
8595	none	@drurbanski we've got a PR firm. I might toss this their way.
8596	none	I'm not really concerned when it comes to gaters being gatery about *me*  but regarding this org  that's a problem.
8597	none	@athenahollow on one hand  the only voice she has is with gaters - which doesn't really affect OAPI's reach.
8598	none	SO READY. #warlords #selfie http://t.co/byVeuYJUru
8599	none	@JWYoder i can't play this game drunk.
8600	none	@devesine @CrashOverrideNW eh  this is turning into more of a legal concern.

8602	none	@karlthepagan @Professor_D given the changes in recruiting  i'm not really surprised. it was already going downhill. :(
8603	none	@tmclaughbos ... and this is why i hate that bot. because it's a misconfigured PoS that doesn't have _ebooks in it's name.
8604	none	@trek @g33klady wait WHICH D&amp;D VERSION
8605	none	If you get a follow from @randileeharper  yes  that is me. Being a CEO is scary  and I want a private account for yelling :P
8606	none	@mattstratton dude stop snapping at me what is your deal
8607	none	If you send a follow request and I know you  I'll likely approve it. If I don't know you... meh. maybe.
8608	none	@srhbutts can you send it up? i'm not exactly at my computer right now.
8609	none	This is a conversation I had with one of Chums friends earlier today. http://t.co/VsDCnNjGwx
8610	none	@tmclaughbos @mattstratton needs to rename the bot to something_ebooks and this wouldn't be a problem.
8611	none	@cigardubey i'm starting to do more stuff that is team-based though  so i'm thinking tweetdeck is the way to go.
8612	none	@kantrn SO MUCH POCKY
8613	none	I just couldn't ever develop lasting romantic feelings for anyone that prefered D&amp;D 4th edition over 3.5.
8614	none	@Professor_D @karlthepagan a community is generally great at policing itself  but not once the well is already poisoned. or something.

8618	none	@LynnMagic this is awesome  and I love this.
8619	none	@athenahollow @JWYoder @ChrisWarcraft mayyybe. i don't like virtual d&amp;d. i can't literally set things on fire and cause havoc.

8621	none	@MethyleneGaming 5th edition doesn't exist. WE DON'T SPEAK OF THAT
8622	none	I have the fitbit Aria scale. It's a wifi scale  logs to internet. Which is awesome. But not for the reasons you'd think.
8623	none	@RachelShadoan @osbridge ughhhh now to decide what to submit. &gt;.&gt;
8624	none	She's trying to summon a mob  making false allegations about OAPI  and in general  acting... worrisome. Pondering if I need to lawyer up.
8625	none	oooo. Almost forgot  need to submit to CFP for #osbridge. :)
8626	none	@cigardubey right now? multiple browsers :P   i should set up tweetdeck for this.
8627	none	@srhbutts hmm. that tweet may be actionable.
8628	none	@mcclure111 hi. Ex-enforcer her. Enforcers are now paid. They didn't used to be  but then state law required it.

8631	none	@Glinner @ashleylynch @SuperSpacedad what i took out of this is that i am @Glinner's sockpuppet  correct me if I am wrong.
8632	none	@pinefoxi well  i bought a case of it  sooo.... :P

8640	none	@Alan_Au happy to discuss on facebook in PM  but not publicly calling out their names on twitter. it would be a bad idea.
8641	none	@JWYoder perl requires little logic :P
8642	none	@Professor_D @karlthepagan i thought about this idea  and i would like it... but in general  i've seen [E] quality drop in past 5 yrs
8643	none	@CortanaV i don't think so. it was just found.
8644	none	@CuriousQuail yes
8645	none	@Shervyn nonprofits have weird restrictions. I'm still learning the ropes. I just assume everything is going to be difficult.

8653	none	@Shervyn i don't even know what that is! oh gosh.
8654	none	@cypheroftyr aw. &gt;.&gt;
8655	none	@wetsprocket but given that these people seem to not understand the difference between charity and NPO  why bother giving them my time?
8656	none	@tommckearney that's how it works with a private account.
8657	none	lol what? http://t.co/8XuVkjayjB
8658	none	@wetsprocket I didn't read them. :P  I was sent a few screencaps  which is why I was a bit concerned.

8665	none	@Shervyn like i would owe you  big time.
8666	none	@Shervyn I don't have a problem getting tech companies involved. The concern is just funding everything.
8667	none	@Shervyn I have one. I just have to talk to them. Mostly musing.
8668	none	I guess I've been doing a good enough job that a PUA/MRA site decided I was public enemy #1. Something to write home about?
8669	none	@cigardubey tweetdeck has gotten a LOT better! they finally fixed the big blocklist bugs.
8670	none	This reminds me of barrens chat.

8675	none	@LaserVueEye always. :)
8676	none	@wetsprocket the only thing that's really concerning is that she's stalkerish in her obsession. reminds me of dude that showed up at my work
8677	none	@AnthonyBriggs speaking of which  i was able to oom my t2.micro servers with that script. :P hehe.
8678	none	@Shervyn I need to be less uncomfortable talking about money. I don't like asking for it. Really bad at that.
8679	none	"If I see 1 more ""chief diversity officer"" talking about 1st amendment rights while not protecting victims of harassment  I might get angry."

8682	none	@j4cob @xor oh  good. was really worried.
8683	none	Time to learn the art of writing to apply for grants. Seems like different orgs prefer drastically different styles  high level vs detailed.
8684	none	@BrianHallDev redis is overkill for what i'm doing. i want something more portable/daemonless.
8685	none	@cjcsuhta full blown redis is overkill for what I'm doing. Will try this out. :)
8686	none	The more companies I talk to  the more I realize we're going to need employees - and a steady form of funding to pay them. Excited!
8687	none	@Skawtnyc @gregtitus  that's a relief.
8688	none	@Aiiane i can't wait! :)  it's going to be awesome. great meeting with you.
8689	none	@Shervyn I don't have to do it  but given that it's such a high priority  I need to put some time into it until we have it figured out.
8690	none	@wetsprocket and that shit freaks me out. not that she would likely do anything  but that she could rile someone up enough to do something.
8691	none	@DJCPI @TheQuinnspiracy @metafilter i saw. &lt;3 metafilter. :)

8834	none	@theMirai @SirGoldenrod @sloshedtrain2 @srhbutts it's tied to twitter user IDs. and it's not a constant update. it updates when i run it.

8864	none	@theMirai @SirGoldenrod @sloshedtrain2 @srhbutts furthermore  blockbot isn't even my code. ggautoblocker is. blockbot is by someone else.
8865	none	The officer looks ready to cry.
8866	none	I'd be happy to get an adult  but leo wouldn't adjust well. He thinks he is dominant to everything. Can't have a big dog  he gets protective

9089	none	@BrownBagPantry Fortunately  we've got controls on Twitter like block and mute  which keep us from seeing *most* things we don't like.
9090	none	@SFtheWolf but the cover itself - well  the tweets capped in that article do a better job explaining than i could.
9091	none	@SFtheWolf did you read the text of the article? that picture is really creepy/triggering as fuck.
