7568	none	@VexingVision i honestly have no idea how i am managing this. it is surprising.
7569	none	@xmjEE also  mentioning both of us in the same tweet is pretty much a sure-fire way to make sure that they do notice &amp; jump on me.
7570	none	@dylanw i'm pretty familiar with the concept  but not the feeling. ^.^ good read  though.
7571	none	I guess that's one way to get around the user token count limitation per app ID.
7572	none	@MyersNFL oh  gosh. i hope you feel better. :(
7573	none	@jcmanous looks neat. I need to start keeping my eyes open for CFPs.
7574	none	We're all very different people with very different backstories and purposes  but we respect each other. @Spacekatgal @TheQuinnspiracy
7575	none	He's said that he's backing out  but I think this remains to be seen. However  I'm optimistic.
7576	none	I'm nervous in a weird way  because these people are kind of like my extended family. It's not a hard talk to give to strangers.
7577	none	Oh  hell. Is Blizzard proxying tweets instead of sending the tweet content directly to twitter from the WoW client?
7578	none	@kebesays no  my blog post. :)

7585	none	RT @BigBupIsWatchin: @freebsdgirl THEY DON'T EVEN GO HERE
7586	none	The best part about posting to WoW forums is that it's only for ppl that have played the game &amp; thus will keep many gaters from descending.
7587	none	Let's talk about what it means to be a victim. http://t.co/FInA7zfTTT
7588	none	I need to think about this. I don't think I like this.
7589	none	I'm almost in sniffles at the thought of seeing my FreeBSD extended family again after so many years. Clearly I need more sleep.

7603	none	@beardyblue @emily_esque general folks in the legal field at this point  but issues will mostly center around local harassment/stalking laws

7609	none	@Kickyfast @bonegolem @Totalbiscuit @srhbutts nice interface! much prettier than the grafana setup that i'm using.
7610	none	@ShriekAPotomos Anyone that is getting harassed is welcome to come to me for help. it's all anonymous.
7611	none	I have no intent on linking to the articles where he stated he was backing out. They were an attempt to save face  not an apology.
7612	none	@JWYoder more so because they've known me for such a long time. talking about polarizing personal experiences is easier with strangers.
7613	none	I mean  we're at *least* 14. @Spacekatgal @TheQuinnspiracy
7614	none	The rule of the Apple mini-displayport to DVI adapter is that you will never be able to find it when you finally need it.

7634	none	@MetroidThief for victims of abuse  it's often not discussed because of a feeling of shame. victim assumes fault  then public assigns blame.

7637	none	I'm still not 100% certain this is happening. But the delay between sending a tweet and seeing it appear is far too long.

7643	none	@Sir5000 i can't receive tweets in game  only send. :P
7644	none	I think the biggest problem I have with it is that there's too much of a reliance on WoW services for an external mechanism.
7645	none	Someday  I'm going to drink &amp; start submitting pull requests to various FOSS projects' Makefiles to play fitting theme music during a build.
7646	none	@Blackamazon i really appreciate the kind words from you. i'm a big admirer of your voice. &lt;3

7652	none	@Blackamazon EXACTLY THIS.
7653	none	@Blackamazon woah. nah. you're amazing and one of my favorite people on twitter. &lt;3
7654	none	@MetroidThief I'm usually optimistic about people and their ability to change. But I've heard enough background story from reliable sources.
7655	none	This isn't going to work  because we've all got a maturity greater than 12 year olds. @spacekatgal @TheQuinnspiracy http://t.co/40EZQvdzAF

7658	none	@beardyblue @emily_esque police tend to take reports of online harassment/threats a lot more seriously when a lawyer is involved.

7664	none	ugh. no. I am finally dealing with imposter syndrome. This is not a thing that I'm used to having to manage. crap.
7665	none	@Xer0Dynamite uh  okay?
7666	none	She had her chance to understand  but she's decided to dig in her heels. Whelp. Lesson learned  eh?
7667	none	Don't think that it won't go unnoticed/unchallenged. Don't put on a cape unless you plan on being a hero. It's not a photo op. It's a job.
7668	none	Pickaxe is the new crowbar. http://t.co/BCSpxTOtGE
7669	none	KISS (keep it simple  stupid) very much applies to designing a new feature. If Blizzard is proxying tweets  that's unnecessary and bad.
7670	none	RT @PeerWorker: @freebsdgirl You just lost $10 from crowd funding of your cause.  Choose your battles.

7672	none	RT @GordonGuano: @freebsdgirl I am really curious as to why someone would try to sell their own children for crystal meth.
7673	none	I reached out to @ninaburleigh with concerns the day the article was published. No response. Nina cares more about page views than problems.
7674	none	@KaitlynBurnell given the *massive* glee i'm seeing from GG irt that tweet  it's concerning that he's not retracting or explaining 'bully'
7675	none	He's been offered contact info from those he's speaking with should he care to contribute. He's utilized none of this. I am unimpressed.
7676	none	RT @shanemadden: @freebsdgirl It's about ethics in controllers on dogs. http://t.co/oYgB4cLN9W
7677	none	According to @ninaburleigh  we should be happy that dudes are talking about feminism. Even if they are telling us how we are doing it wrong.
7678	none	@functionalform you should see his guilty look.
7679	none	@PeerWorker and i couldn't give less fucks about alienating followers by giving them an opinion they don't like.
7680	none	Please no pile-ons. Don't tweet at him  etc. I think the conversation is concerning in that we need to discuss what bully means.

7691	none	At this moment in time  I am unaware of any effort he has made into this space. I'm tied in w/many orgs. His name has never once come up.
7692	none	@MaxwellTolvo Yeah  this probably isn't a good public conversation to have. I just stay away from her.
7693	none	@DanielleIsANerd go fuck yourself. &lt;3
7694	none	How many toys can be stacked on his head? http://t.co/sZJwNbmVL1
7695	none	I've also been told that some of the people mentioned in @ninaburleigh's article didn't even talk to her. She quoted them without asking.
7696	none	@KaitlynBurnell if i was looking for pitchforks  i'd point out a white dude in a position of power accused a minority of bullying him. :P
7697	none	@MetroidThief @deathofrats01 awwwww
7698	none	Did you hear that? That's the sound of a bunch of women in tech setting up filters to fwd emails from @ninaburleigh to /dev/null. Good job.

7705	none	@GavinRamblesOn tbh  i feel bad anytime anyone actively enters this fight without knowing about the personal cost.
7706	none	@KaitlynBurnell thank you for calling me on this  though. i probably should have made that more clear in the original tweets.
7707	none	I bought crepes but I don't really know what they are so I am just going to call this a fruit burrito. http://t.co/p7gZt7P0Oh
7708	none	@EvanPascoe @Spacekatgal @GI_AndyMc THANK YOU RANDOM INTERNET PERSON FOR INSERTING YOURSELF WHEN I SAID NO PILE-ONS.

7715	none	@SuperSpacedad yeahh. I'm not going to retweet that. That chick is mentally unstable &amp; loves to post private convs. It's not OK.

7717	none	Which is fine  I guess. But she went out of her way to talk to wadhwa. Interesting  no?
7718	none	"Frankly  it's a little irritating to see some guy with a huge following come along and say ""I'm gonna do stuff!"" and then... do nothing."
7719	none	@eidlonimp oh. i've got him blocked. i didn't even see that.
7720	none	@voretaq7 i had a bunch of clip on hair extensions from when i had longer hair. decided to let him use them. ;)
7721	none	omg twitter you are killing me with dumb this morning.
7722	none	There is currently a vocal male on twitter that claims to be all about anti-harassment. He has defended GamerGate in the past.
7723	none	@Ethelmonster @ninaburleigh @wadhwa lol  she was one of the people that gave him a platform and then ignored detractors.
7724	none	@deathofrats01 haha  mine is worse. :P
7725	none	I'm talking about people that take an active stand to say they want to create solutions for harassment  but do nothing beyond get RTed.
7726	none	@MetroidThief @deathofrats01 his face is a bit differently structured. he looks a lot like a collie in some regards.

7733	none	@deathofrats01 LOOKING AT YOUR ICONS  JUDGINGGGGG
7734	none	@tpstigers it depends on how you define meaningful. if 3 people listen to you vs 30k  there's a huge difference in voice.
7735	none	@KaitlynBurnell the use of the word 'bully' in this context is worrisome and relevant to any conversation i have.
7736	none	@tpstigers doesn't drive  but is in many cases an accurate reflection.
7737	none	@EvanPascoe https://t.co/CQyEYwtEDw

7742	none	@deathofrats01 yup! probably a mix of some sort. he's from the shelter. :)
7743	none	If this is an ally  then fuck everything &amp; set the world on fire. @ninaburleigh was dumb enough to get sucked into his bullshit vortex.
7744	none	Or  well  something happened. A hashtag was started by harassers to support him. So  that's something. I guess.
7745	none	RT @MetroidThief: @freebsdgirl https://t.co/xIq8E2seZQ
7746	none	@KaylinEvergreen so am i  tbh. it took a few tries to make it balance.
7747	none	@MaxwellTolvo @SuperSpacedad she threatened to cut herself if we didn't pay her money.
7748	none	@PeerWorker uh. because one group is literally killing people? are you nuts?
7749	none	@KaitlynBurnell i'm a little concerned. the tweet still exists. i see no retraction published.
7750	none	".@jlorry96 twitter search for my name and ""set yourself on fire"" and see if i give two shits about what you think."
7751	none	@Animecommentary @ninaburleigh who are you referring to with 'we'?
7752	none	@KaitlynBurnell to be clear  i'm not bringing this up to defend bri. i'm aware that she's fully capable of defending herself.
7753	none	@tpstigers as someone that went from ~4k followers to what i've got now  i've seen a huge difference.
7754	none	@PeerWorker yes. given that one group routinely posts mutilated bodies on twitter along with american passports  i'd say they are worse.
7755	none	@kuuuramantoonis @DanielleIsANerd it was up on 8chan. someone probably has an archive somewhere.

7757	none	Since this was questioned  I should be clear. I'm not talking about supporters  or just people with opinions.
7758	none	For everyone that is involved in this space  there's a huge personal risk. People get targeted. Friends and family get targeted.

7764	none	@GavinRamblesOn what this person has done is not just voiced an opinion. i'm not going to get a pile-on going  so i'm not giving specifics.
7765	none	@tpstigers completely disagree. it's industry recognition.
7766	none	@PeerWorker @EvvyKube Nope. You keep saying that  but we both know you're lying. Show me where I called you stupid.
7767	none	@PeerWorker @DerAmazingLarry @Quinnae_Moon @feministing you're really fond of lying about everything. I said they aren't ISIS.

7791	none	Trying to decide if I have time to contact police before call w/lawyer. Never thought I'd say this unless I was in trouble/tequila involved.
7792	none	Every time I meet with a journalist that is about to post something that is going to make GamerGate angry  I suggest using #ggautoblocker.
7793	none	yes i turned on profanity filter because i'm trying to curse less. it's not working  as you can see.
7794	none	@Thunder_Chicken @EvvyKube @chromatic_x not sure if being sarcastic or obtuse.
7795	none	https://t.co/mQaSFPwoFp // @hridaybala
7796	none	@PeerWorker @EvvyKube I don't think you understand what bullying or harassment is at all.
7797	none	@PeerWorker @EvvyKube @Spacekatgal @CBCRadioQ 'colleague' - we don't work together. collusion!
7798	none	@haley @JordanL @TheQuinnspiracy @voiceofrae @Spacekatgal only if you come with us bby
7799	none	@PeerWorker why do you think that you know more about the abuse i personally receive than i do?
7800	none	@apfergus i'm reading about it now. :)
7801	none	@PeerWorker @EvvyKube where did I call you stupid? Show me the tweet.
7802	none	@PeerWorker @krisaubuchon holy shit. seriously? i've done research into both groups. I've seen the tweets &amp; patterns. GamerGate isn't ISIS.
7803	none	@voiceofrae @TheQuinnspiracy @Spacekatgal HEY I JUST MET YOU
7804	none	@GodOfCyanide @PeerWorker http://t.co/NGP9HAcuDo &lt;3
7805	none	Sometimes a lot of this still feels like playing at being a responsible grownup. Discovering much as I travel this path. Good place to be.
7806	none	@PeerWorker @EvvyKube you are changing your mind now? You've been saying I called you stupid. Still waiting for sauce.
7807	none	omg it's here http://t.co/XVvTDVPmK8
7808	none	@erinjmccarty just enjoying youtube playlist while pvping. &lt;3
7809	none	@8BitBecca lawyer is unrelated to police. ;)
7810	none	RT @Adobe: For those seeing #WhiteandGold in #TheDress (http://t.co/pNG9tXu5pU)  @HopeTaylorPhoto ends the debate. http://t.co/W7TwQJy13m
7811	none	sweetie  you wandered into my mentions threatening me with financial consequences. this isn't bullying. it's backbone. @PeerWorker
7812	none	YESSSSS. [Photo B.O.M.B.] http://t.co/DpLYHcm8YZ #Warcraft
7813	none	I... I either just got really lucky or somehow found a way around the ashran queue timer. uh.
7814	none	I'm not even going to lie. This makes me giggle a little bit on the inside.
7815	none	This is the best point I've seen made about #thedress  ever. @lead_miniature
7816	none	No one said threats weren't serious. However  there's a difference between ISIS and GamerGate. @PeerWorker
7817	none	RT @DernKat: @freebsdgirl thanks bing http://t.co/7lwKQVUImv
7818	none	.@PeerWorker online harassment is a serious problem  and it needs to be addressed. but making false equivalencies won't get you anywhere.
7819	none	@PeerWorker you made a false equivalency  I called it on you  and you threatened financial consequences.
7820	none	@PeerWorker @EvvyKube uh. You came to me with financial threats.
7821	none	@voiceofrae @TheQuinnspiracy @Spacekatgal BUT HERE'S MY NUMBER
7822	none	@JordanL @TheQuinnspiracy @voiceofrae @Spacekatgal i don't know. but i feel like @haley would.
7823	none	@KirinDave uh. hi. i'm going to call you on that line right there. what rating do you play at in WoW?
7824	none	@RealDackFayden @tauriqmoosa yeah. i tried to talk to him. he won't even tell me why he thinks this is a thing.
7825	none	@KirinDave I love it. I'm invested in it. My friends play it. I've played GW. It's ok  but the PvP just isn't as good.
7826	none	WIRED IS WRONG.
7827	none	@PeerWorker @DerAmazingLarry @Quinnae_Moon @feministing stop trying to cause shit. it's not going to work.
7828	none	Let me make this super fucking clear. I will not compromise my beliefs in any way just to get donations. That isn't happening  ever.
7829	none	Sorry  I'm not going to say GamerGate is the same as ISIS  and you can shove your donation up your ass. @PeerWorker
7830	none	@PeerWorker @EvvyKube when you're an asshole in someone's mentions and they react  it's not bullying.
7831	none	@KirinDave &amp; if you want to sulk about being called on it  i guess that's your prerogative.
7832	none	@hideous_pizza i am grandma. :P
7833	none	RT @andreajanelle9: Raise your hand if you have ever felt personally victimized by #TheDress http://t.co/jTcE9DvbQr
7834	none	@KirinDave sigh. don't get like that. it just came off really  really poorly.
7835	none	I love Ashran. http://t.co/HahQQqAe3O
7836	none	To be clear  I'm not in trouble. And the call with PD has nothing to do w/call with lawyer  both related to work :P @MrTheGeoff
7837	none	RT @lead_miniature: @freebsdgirl I would never  ever want to get into a debate with *you* over whether or not something is blue
7838	none	@voiceofrae @TheQuinnspiracy @Spacekatgal SO CALL ME MAYBE
7839	none	Look  I don't care about your photoshops  or your computers  or your wizardry. The earth isn't flat and #TheDress is white and gold.
7840	none	@PeerWorker @EvvyKube show me where I called you stupid.
7841	none	RT @PeerWorker: @freebsdgirl The threats are either serious or they aren't.  I guess you don't view #GamerGate as emotional terrorism.
7842	none	@PeerWorker I'm from the south. Sweetie is another way to talk down and tell someone to go fuck themselves.
7843	none	@PeerWorker @DerAmazingLarry @Quinnae_Moon @feministing however  I'm going to block you now. Because what you're doing is abusive and not OK
7844	none	@KirinDave i will punch you.
7845	none	@StephenAtWar @PeerWorker @krisaubuchon yup. something is happening. not sure what.
7846	none	@KirinDave GW2 players love to make digs at WoW being old. WoW is old  but it's also pretty well balanced. I PvP competitively.
7847	none	How have I never heard of ball culture? This sounds amazing.
7848	none	@KirinDave i don't pve.
7849	none	@PartyshipDown it's rather presumptuous to assume that i'm straight.

7854	none	@PeerWorker @EvvyKube but protip  you'll never have the freedom to wander around being a jerk without consequence.
7855	none	@PeerWorker @EvvyKube it's about ethics in journalism.
7856	none	@JoeMOwens newp.
7857	none	@PeerWorker @EvvyKube you've now repeatedly told people that I called you stupid  though.
7858	none	@PeerWorker I mean this from the bottom of my heart: Go fuck yourself.
7859	none	You're not going to get the response you're looking for. Give up. @PeerWorker
7860	none	RT @korvys: @saintneko @freebsdgirl http://t.co/59GS1U6kcL
7861	none	@jlorry96 he also makes claims of racism if someone calls him on repeatedly using feminist terms incorrectly. i. don't. care.

7865	none	RT @ComposerDavid: @freebsdgirl I'm not entirely sure I agree with you there.
7866	none	If @twitter @safety wants more details  they should ask for it in the interface when I file the report - not 30 seconds later in an email.
7867	none	If there is one thing in life we can count on  it's if you ask a question regarding opinions on Apple products  no one will agree.
7868	none	So  @GMShivers claims that only people new to the industry claim sexism exists. Yawn. I'm a 15+ year engineer. Try again.
7869	none	I guess it's one type of strength to make it this far  another to recognize the problem &amp; speak out  not playing boys club games.
7870	none	The two accounts I reported (@fart2continue and @imh8bit) were both suspended  but this is not a good response.

7878	none	@cericneesh there's a white/black option.
7879	none	This isn't rare. This isn't even GamerGate related. This happens all. the. time.
7880	none	Relevant comments: http://t.co/LA7E2waYJU // @mattjbaldo
7881	none	I'm optimistic. This isn't the end game. Twitter's announcement was a single step in a long path in mitigating abuse problems.
7882	none	@encthenet indeed. :)
7883	none	@Litazia yup
7884	none	RT @athenahollow: @freebsdgirl He REALLY picked the wrong women to go after me thinks.

7888	none	RT @TheRealNimoy: Leonard Nimoy 1931-2015  Read: http://t.co/pw7zYRRlts
7889	none	FYGM is keeping the status quo so you can feel some kind of superiority over the women that opted not to put up with the abuse.
7890	none	Star Trek was one of the only TV shows I  could watch when I was a kid.
7891	none	@Animecommentary no worries.
7892	none	@sakjur i usually go with thin crust  garlic pesto sauce  feta + garlic toppings. is good even with chain restaurants.
7893	none	Not only that  but this rocket surgeon apparently doesn't understand the difference between comments and man pages. Isn't he precious?
7894	none	@Sarcasshole @1lb_cake @Blacktric @DoUEvenPraise laid off  along with a whole game team. &lt;3

7899	none	(If it didn't work  you guys would probably be crying about it stealing your freeze peaches a whole lot less.) http://t.co/lMSYD7W2iC
7900	none	It's easy to think that our experiences are indicative of everyone's experiences. I've fallen victim to that thinking before.
7901	none	Let's not forget that the person that started these rumblings about my code got fired from Zynga for being impossible to work with.
7902	none	RT @mczub: @freebsdgirl it feels like only new people claim sexism exist because the sexism already drove away the veterans
7903	none	"Unfortunately  a positive experience doesn't cancel out a negative. And playing the ""cool girl"" game isn't a good look for anyone."
7904	none	More shit that dudes don't have to put up with. http://t.co/VW943zqxcT
7905	none	this isn't just gamergate this isn't just gamergate this isn't just gamergate this is a more obvious version of what already happens
7906	none	Watching people like @GMShivers further FYGM culture. That's... unfortunate.
7907	none	http://t.co/9yNL4eQcMP is a good option  but it's a partial solution. We need the ability to filter accts w/o phone number attached.
7908	none	Uh  @twitter @safety? I am displeased that you want me to reply to these emails with more details when I file a report.
7909	none	SPOCK DIED???
7910	none	Sure! AMA is here: http://t.co/KKCSABHgzs // @mattjbaldo
7911	none	Want more women in FOSS? Dropkick these people into the sun.

7917	none	@ForQuestions1 thank you
7918	none	@carolinesinders @herecomesfran *hugs*
7919	none	If us women in tech are strong enough to get this far  why aren't we strong enough to mentor  to push for change? No more FYGM.
7920	none	"RT @tehnakki: ""@NASALaserComm: What do #LaserComm and #TheDress have in common? http://t.co/nMNXCmRt1n"" @ipgd NASA's getting in to it too!"
7921	none	The Developer Policy needs an update that allows us to filter non-promoted tweets. Twitter clients continue to have bugs w/large block lists
7922	none	Things are happening. Big things. I could not be more excited.1
7923	none	RT @gabriel403: @freebsdgirl I disagree
7924	none	I miss you.
7925	none	omg I am listening to an apple genius dude tell this old woman how to use email and it is adorable.
7926	none	@MHWitchfinder you guys don't even know the difference between the 3. Lolnope
7927	none	Instead of perpetuating FYGM culture  why not try to fix things? Why not try to remove some of the hurdles? Would that be so bad  really?
7928	none	http://t.co/bN7be6njVT
7929	none	She's making a list She's checking it twice
7930	none	Female devs make me uncomfortable  so let's imply her work was a single commit. http://t.co/tcBENL2vxh
7931	none	He tried to do an AMA on reddit about working at zynga  implied all of his coworkers were twats  got shouted down by all of them.
7932	none	@_last_time_lord yes
7933	none	@miscu_ I have bots to block all of that.
7934	none	@ChrisWarcraft @alexlifschitz prove it. WHERE IS THE PROOF???
7935	none	RT @KaitlynBurnell: @freebsdgirl @GMShivers Yep  10+ year engineer here  can confirm.
7936	none	Couldn't find another job in the gaming industry after that because insulting your coworkers/former employers is just something you don't do
7937	none	@jeremiahfelt Twitter  email  Evernote  web. Hearthstone.
7938	none	@gamerfortruth @athenahollow he had a huge ego  never produced anything  and everyone hated him. kind of like twitter.
7939	none	So now he targets women  because you know  they can fight back a lot less. lolllll.
7940	none	@allaboutgeorge @kevin_finke @TheRealNimoy you had to pick the tweet about spock and not about drinking with star trek. :P

7945	none	rage eating pocky
7946	none	@sakjur hah. not from a chain pizza place.
7947	none	I didn't have an outward emotional reaction when my own grandmother died  but I am crying for Nimoy.
7948	none	Until twitter provides us with a way to filter new accounts or provides a higher barrier to entry  these are just words that mean little.
7949	none	Vibrating with excitement. Every day brings us closer to being able to make the announcement.
7950	none	@gamerfortruth @athenahollow rogue literally got fired from the company that made farmville. no one wanted to work w/him there.
7951	none	FYGM culture is a complete lack of empathy. I fought my way here  sure. Do I think anyone else should have to do that? Hell  no.
7952	none	@arhourigan @Spacekatgal it's been my name for many years :) since before Twitter existed.
7953	none	iPad Air 2 or iPad mini 3?
7954	none	RT @gater_ebooks: Just trying to make people I care about gender fluid.
7955	none	@TheDaveCA oh yeah? i didn't hear about that.
7956	none	@InfiniteClock most abuse comes from gamergate accounts that are 30-90 days old.
7957	none	"FYGM culture is a real issue. Like  ""I fought my way here  and it sucked  but I'm strong. If you can't do this  it's your problem."""
7958	none	Not so subtle hint: just spent a while with apple opening up a very specific kind of account.
7959	none	My take on twitter's safety update: propaganda. Doesn't give clear info on what these new actions are.
7960	none	I'm going to drink and Star Trek marathon tonight.

7963	none	"This is coming from the same group that claimed I faked my LinkedIn because it was ""impossible"" for a 33 yr old to have done all of that."
7964	none	@Nayadrikj OKAY I'M BACK
7965	none	@ChrisWarcraft i have never seen a single indication that roguestar is in any way technically competent.
7966	none	Aw  GamerGate harassment squad. Did I say something to make you mad? http://t.co/oTsgWCnC75
7967	none	@tmclaughbos @_RogueSt4r to be fair  most of my activity happened under my own commit bit.
7968	none	More than a little entertained at all of the gaters that are upset that I fight back instead of just shutting up. Fighting back is bullying.
7969	none	@MacLemon @dtm609 @Osw94k you're thinking kernel  not userland. quite a bit of recent(ish) freebsd userland exists in osx.
7970	none	So she can try &amp; claim innocence  but statistics paint her as being someone to avoid. And I've been in her sights for a while. Oh well.
7971	none	How should I even classify this? Wielding a mob? Indirect bullying? I'm not sure.
7972	none	@PhoenixDK i'm thinking about it. ideas aren't really fully formed  though.
7973	none	@leel8on indeed. although the police were fairly nice. :)
7974	none	Like when @GMShivers said that only industry newbies believed sexism existed. Or when @JennofHardwire sends her harassment squad after ppl.
7975	none	YES I HAVE A SELFIE CAMERA http://t.co/NlTB319EFW
7976	none	@zeynep @delbius that makes sense. also  how horrible is it that block has become muscle memory? :P
7977	none	@PhoenixDK yeah  i need to start looking at finding a... oh wait. i can't drop that news yet. :P
7978	none	I don't usually like pointing out individual names unless they've gone above and beyond in attempts to hurt people.
7979	none	omg watching freebsd committers just rail at gamergaters for doubting my freebsd contributions
7980	none	@jakeboxer @tmclaughbos @_RogueSt4r laughing my ass off right now at people from github AND freebsd telling rogue he's wrong.

7987	none	The smear tactics aren't going to work. These people have known me for over a decade.
7988	none	@deathofrats01 yup. ^.^ unless it's your field  it's not surprising that you wouldn't know.
7989	none	@Beau_Bales @Patreon &lt;3 thank you :)
7990	none	@deathofrats01 I know *nothing* about writing code in windows. :P
7991	none	@pr1ntf they searched for my *twitter name* in freebsd's *github*
7992	none	that moment when you silence a mage and they start backpedalling and you just KNOW it's about to go down
7993	none	@MacLemon @dtm609 @Osw94k not entirely accurate. if you run strings through /bin  you'll find freebsd committer names of recent years.
7994	none	They also love to add 10 years to my age. Which doesn't bother me. I grew up envious of UNIX beards.
7995	none	@Makofury glad I could help  and I'm so sorry that you're going through that. :(
7996	none	@Nayadrikj STOP TAKING BATHROOM SELFIES YOU FUCKING PEASANT
7997	none	@iglvzx he expects unix logins to map to github usernames - which they rarely will.
7998	none	UNIX logins are restricted to 8 characters  darling. FreeBSD uses SVN  not git. I believe SVN history is imported to github.
7999	none	btw  guys. I'm an admin of the OpenBSD facebook group. So  you know. COLLUSION.
8000	none	It's been several years since I've contributed code. This was due to a conflict with an employer. I *asked* for my commit bit to be retired.
8001	none	@Osw94k I would put cash money on them not understanding your profile pic.
8002	none	Posing for extra style points before wrecking *everyone*. #selfie #warlords http://t.co/Jr11tzm49x
8003	none	All that collusion in the BSD community sure is hard to keep track of.
8004	none	@SlaunchaMan interesting  tho  that it still found most of them.
8005	none	INTEL  YOU CAN'T SIT WITH US
8006	none	Oh  yeah. and FreeBSD is the OS that runs on your Playstations. Why so salty?
8007	none	Getting ready to kill stuff with my teammates! #selfie #warlords http://t.co/TyEhfh3V0S
8008	none	So  just to save you all some time  BSD is my family. The only negative response GG ever received was from a non-dev.
8009	none	@scaryjen @Alfuriuskj @Nayadrikj undead 4ever.
8010	none	@tpw_rules I can prove that my code is in FreeBSD. And there are articles that state that FreeBSD is running on the PS3 and PS4.
8011	none	OK  that's enough poking the bear. Have a lot to do today. My most difficult decision is going to be what to wear. &gt;.&gt;
8012	none	RT @RichFelker: @freebsdgirl Standard operating procedure for bullies is to paint victims as perpetrators of bullying to authority.
8013	none	In short  this is the most hilarious GamerGate BSD fail I have ever seen. #FreeBSD #OpenBSD #PCBSD http://t.co/poaOZ93QEf
8014	none	@basvandewiel there should be a link to this in the patreon. :)
8015	none	PC-BSD is a fork that is mostly funded by iXSystems  the organization that runs FreeBSD marketing. It's a frontend on top of FreeBSD.
8016	none	@jessimckenzi @zeynep @twitter @delbius @TweetDeck confirmed  seeing the same thing in *web*.
8017	none	BSD is a good community. Wandering into it and attacking one of the few women contributors is going to get some people talking.
8018	none	@basvandewiel paypal@freebsdgirl.com &lt;3
8019	none	That moment when I think that I'm out of coffee... then pull 12 oz of ground arabica out of my backpack. Yes! More glory to the coffee gods.
8020	none	And I've asked them to stay uninvolved. But attacking my work with them? GLHF. You're bringing it on yourself.
8021	none	The amount of Mean Girls mentality coming from GG supporters is hilarious. ON WEDNESDAYS WE EMAIL KOTAKU.
8022	none	"RT @CatDeSpira: @freebsdgirl  Ignore fools. Embrace the term ""bitch"". It means you have strength and express your own opinions. ""Bitch"" is …"
8023	none	@JordanL yup!
8024	none	@PhoenixDK i think there's a really fine line beyond being vocal about your experiences and indirect bullying.
8025	none	"""I don't retreat.  I reload."""

8029	none	@SilverMillsy nope! 34 in september. :)
8030	none	@tmclaughbos @_RogueSt4r but rogue isn't really... dev competent. he thinks all dev happens under github.
8031	none	"But all of these attacks of ""not enough commits"" or ""had a dude do it for you"" or ""slept with people"" proves my point. Thanks for that."
8032	none	@SlaunchaMan that's still not my login for freebsd. :P
8033	none	@stubbornella people will find a way to interpret anything to match their message  unfortunately.
8034	none	I have never felt more supported and safe than I do around the FreeBSD developer community. They are amazing  and I love them.
8035	none	Presented without comment. http://t.co/9MWQFS8Css
8036	none	My fav part of skimming GG tweets is seeing so many people insist that they are unable to develop their views with experience.
8037	none	I've been watching Jenn for a while  deciding if it was worth saying anything. Her tweets are benign  but the *response* is not.
8038	none	"So far  the primary response I've heard from the FreeBSD dev community in regards to all of this is ""how can we help?"""
8039	none	There's a reason we started tracking all of her followers. An immense amount of racism/sexism/abuse was coming from her corner.
8040	none	Pointed freebsd devs at this thread. Their response: now discussing if they have hipster beards. http://t.co/Bizo592TMj used as an example.
8041	none	Watching other BSD devs tell roguestar he's wrong and it is delicious.

8047	none	Oh  I see. It's @jennofhardwire sending her little harassment squad after me. Like we can't see right through her innocent act.

8052	none	@tmclaughbos @_RogueSt4r I think I got mine because no one else wanted to touch the code I was working with. :)
8053	none	The thing is  you don't actually have to say any of that stuff for us to figure out who it's coming from. It's easy to track social groups.
8054	none	Stand strong. The only comfort I have to give right now is that no one is really listening to this particular group  anyways.

8080	none	A bunch of people poked me about some article that was written. Eh. I don't really care that much.
8081	none	@ArtifexH I thought about putting one of the monitors on top  but then it's too high for me to easily see.
8082	none	I only really have the time to respond to mainstream media. Reviewing everything that GG writes about me would be too time consuming.
8083	none	@Jason_Gio so his opinion on being blocked on twitter is probably fairly predictable.

8266	none	@harper @korvys it's also a license I know well. I agree with the philosophy behind it.
8267	none	You aren't just one person. There are many of us  and we all have voices. But more than that  we have resources  experience  and passion.
8268	none	@harper @korvys I don't like the GPL.
8269	none	RT @randi_ebooks: It's just a lot more experience with women's issues  and don't let the bugs bite.
8270	none	We will be releasing as many tools as possible under the BSD license. @korvys
8271	none	"The scope of the problem can discourage people from trying to fight it. Often this leads to thinking  ""what can I do? I'm just one person."""
8272	none	I do have to go get us an actual business address soon so we can finish with the paperwork to get 501c3 status  so it is all temporary. :)
8273	none	OAPI will focus on creating technical solutions for online abuse. http://t.co/Gh10Nt5rEB
8274	none	I can't believe I'm using this word without irony  but this is setting up to be disruptive as heck.

8276	none	At some point in the future  we will be allowing external developers to contribute. @A_Round_Square
8277	none	I'm so excited about this. We're already doing some great things  and I can't wait until I'm able to tell you more.
8278	none	@TimOfLegend just heard about yesterday. Well done. :)
8279	none	@Stan_Philo agreed.

8281	none	@MarkRubello nope.
8282	none	@damnitscloudy I will never stop posting WoW selfies.
8283	none	@onealexharms we'll be making an announcement about that later. Until paperwork is complete  it's all funded by me &amp; the money from patreon

8285	none	We're creating tools and resources for individuals. We're working directly with companies on developer policies to make this a reality.

8291	none	@mala well  now you might have some idea as to why i've been *SO SLOW* on responding. :P

8293	none	@AndreaFaulds yes and yes
8294	none	@jchackert that's a scary thought :P
8295	none	@SantaCruzTax soon. We've been working on it. Gotta move fast.
8296	none	RT @Keiran3927: @freebsdgirl It's great to see this being tackled on so many different fronts at once! Voltron indeed!
8297	none	Soon soon soon
8298	none	The amount of kind words and support we've received from all of you has been immense. Thank you all so very much.
8299	none	It is fitting that we are now seeing these strong women speaking out and trying to fix problems that others are uncertain of how to tackle.
8300	none	@ashleylynch @join_oapi just the site :)
8301	none	@Aiiane ty. We got that out in a hurry. Will fix it :)
8302	none	@mala we should chat soon. ;)
8303	none	RT @ChrisWarcraft: (And the sad thing is  to list all the names affected by this crap would take days  if not months. Time to fix it.)
8304	none	It is so tempting to wear my Wonder Woman outfit under my normal clothes today. Cape management on BART could be challenging.
8305	none	@DiscordianKitty I kinda laughed at the pic  gotta admit
8306	none	@DocLight email is randi@randi.io
8307	none	I am so tired. Barely slept. Kept waking up to minor adrenaline rush. Need to move quickly  need to get stuff DONE  but really need a nap!

8319	none	@mala how about this - my next week is still empty  but will fill up quick (i'm guessing). email me a time. I'll come visit.
8320	none	RT @Spacekatgal: Having an epic dinner with @Quinnae_Moon and @freebsdgirl.
8321	none	OAPI will be partnering with @crashoverridenw to provide them with the tools they need.
8322	none	@Aiiane awesome! Can't wait to hear from you.
8323	none	@LynnMagic some of it. Many moving parts.
8324	none	It's almost time. :)
8325	none	@JWYoder sent to my reading list for later. Thank you :)
8326	none	We talk about GamerGate a lot. But the truth is  GamerGate isn't the real battle. It's a symptom of a larger problem.
8327	none	Oh gosh she mentioned me and #ggautoblocker in her talk and now I am blushing and trying not to sniffle.
8328	none	I'm a target regardless  and my information was already public. I have adequate physical security  and the local police know who I am.
8329	none	I can't even find the words to describe how much I value the work of all the people I've met during this time. How much I love all of them.

8333	none	RT @femfreq: Just colluding and conspiring with @TheQuinnspiracy http://t.co/25VNDSm7RJ
8334	none	@ashleylynch @join_oapi there's very little in specifics that I am free to discuss at this point. But I can give some overview.
8335	none	We know what online abuse looks like. We've been studying it  and we will create reports and publish our findings.
8336	none	@arrivalgame you too!
8337	none	Online harassment is something most people have faced at some point  regardless of their views on ethics in games journalism.
8338	none	You aren't alone in this. You're never alone in this.
8339	none	@tpstigers depends on the artist ;) my outfit has a cape.
8340	none	In this ongoing tragedy  we found our voices &amp; each other. We have learned to work together  and to support &amp; encourage these amazing women.
8341	none	"The morning after  hung over  struggling to remember how that pile of o'reilly books ended up in your bed. ""WHAT DID I CODE LAST NIGHT"""
8342	none	I appreciate all of the emails regarding the domain WHOIS info  but rest assured  this was deliberate.
8343	none	Alright. Time for me to get off the internet and hide for a bit until I manage sleep. I'll be getting into GDC late tomorrow.
8344	none	@tinkertim shoot me an email. randi at our new domain name :)

8347	none	@JWYoder I'm doing it full time :P
8348	none	Waiting for BART so I can go home and curl up and reflect away from the Internet for a while. Need to calm down and get some rest.
8349	none	@ncoghlan_dev i think it's partially a gender thing  tbh. there aren't a lot of women in leadership positions.
8350	none	@GaminGlennSeto @srhbutts Closer to 200. I wrote it in 20 minutes and was drunk off my ass.
8351	none	@StephenAtWar hah! We have to secure funding first.
8352	none	Having a high level of toxicity in your community can lead to more serious cases of harassment and abuse  so we need to tackle this head on.
8353	none	@ashleylynch it's like reading tabloids. easy to spend too much time reading garbage instead of doing cool things.
8354	none	For the first time in my months of monitoring this  a man momentarily surpassed all the LWs in targeted GamerGate harassment. Congrats?
8355	none	@sschinke @1lb_cake @DiscordianKitty @Grummz Sam  I appreciate you trying to correct people  but please drop my mention :)
8356	none	@TransGeekMovie so looking forward to seeing your tweets!
8357	none	@merlyn IT BEGINS.
8358	none	@XuetaoShi @simon_lindsell no  it wasn't. I'm a minority and it was used to try to silence me and other women.
8359	none	@desertfox899 I'm not just referring to you. Also  you are not tim :/
8360	none	@holinka ARE YOU AT GDC
8361	none	@coconono under my clothes. :P  the cape is in my backpack.
8362	none	@ashleylynch they don't know what we're doing  and they have no power outside of being a distraction.
8363	none	RT @googlecloud: Our last tweet was a mistake. Google supports an open  diverse gaming community for all. We do not support #GamerGate.
8364	none	@StephenAtWar I'll add them to our doc. I understand applying for grants is an art  so it'll likely take a while for us to get it right.
8365	none	@qmarq used to be

8375	none	@andykhouri mad props to @comicsalliance. Well done.
8376	none	Gaming companies are rarely *tech* companies. That's not their core competency  but they deal with inordinate amounts of abuse.
8377	none	@ashleylynch @mistertodd hi i like you &lt;3
8378	none	@SuperSpacedad that's why they really can't effect us. gaming industry is involved  sure. But it's a much bigger conversation.
8379	none	@MariachiMacabre @googlecloud yes. It is unfortunate. People have strong feelings and let them cloud their judgement
8380	none	"@KatieBatterman you rock. &lt;3  i got a text about it at a very inopportune time  was all ""awww  hell  not now."""
8381	none	@8BitBecca I've got a pretty awesome lawyer working with us.
8382	none	@KatieBatterman yeah  we should talk. I was just about to send an email over to them right before I was told it was retracted.
8383	none	"Saw Mozilla and GitHub booths. ""HI I KNOW YOU"""
8384	none	@lysandraws probably. Will be wandering the rest of today.
8385	none	@ashleylynch that's awesome. :)  yeah  i'm not really bothering to read GG's response - although people send me snippets.
8386	none	@mystyr_e OAPI  and yes. we are partnered with crash  but they are victim advocates. we work more with tech &amp; directly with tech cos.
8387	none	@br yes. yes please. take my money.
8388	none	I have certain autoblock scripts that run against my own accounts. several accounts blocked this morning based on tweets they've sent me.

8392	none	RT @TimOfLegend: Man  still trending. People must really love Canada jokes!
8393	none	@DAvallone i'm glad it was able to help. :)
8394	none	Rather amused at the uneducated criticism I'm hearing about from GamerGate. They think a nonprofit means I won't have to pay taxes.
8395	none	@TheQuinnspiracy you are fucking amazing  and i love you.
